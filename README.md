# ðŸŒ± Conway's Game of Life
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. The simulation is written in C and supports initializing the first generation from a text file.

## ðŸŽ® Game Description
Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game where the evolution of a grid of cells is determined by its initial state, with no further input. The world is represented as a finite 2D grid, and each cell in the grid is either alive (1) or dead (0).

## âœ… Rules
Each cellâ€™s state in the next generation depends on its 8 neighbors:

Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies

Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on

Overpopulation: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies

Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell

Note: Cells outside the grid are considered dead.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ lifegame.c       # Core game logic (e.g., rules, next generation)
â”œâ”€â”€ lifegame.h       # Header file for lifegame functions and constants
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c           # Entry point and simulation loop
â”œâ”€â”€ pattern.txt      # Example input file defining the initial state
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation
```

## ðŸ“„ Input Format
The file pattern.txt contains row-column coordinate pairs (0-based index) of initially alive cells. Each line represents one live cell:
```row col```

## ðŸ”¹ Example (pattern.txt):
```bash
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 1
2 2
2 3
```
This means:

The cell at row 1, column 2 is alive

The cell at row 1, column 3 is alive

etc.

All other cells in the grid are assumed dead initially.

## ðŸ§ª How to Compile and Run
1. Compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o game main.c lifegame.c
```
2. Run the game (e.g., for 10 generations):
```bash
./game pattern.txt 10
```
